# Pre-2010

As I'm sure you know, on February 20th, 2004, our lives changed forever! Emily and I were born that morning and you became a mother. Holy crap that is wild. At 35 years old, you and Dad welcomed us into the world and thank God for that.

I have to be honest, I don't remember much, but I love the stories you have of us. Only one of us crying at a time stands out to me, I'm sure that was a blessing. You took some years off of work to take care of us, Dad took one week, haha!

One thing I do remember very vividly is how you used to tuck me and Emily into bed in my room (when we used to have nightly sleepovers in the two twin beds) and when you used to wake us up with your fluffy yellow bathrobe. It always makes me feel so warm and fuzzy to think about that.
