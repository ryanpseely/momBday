As I'm sure you know, on February 20th, 2004, our lives changed forever! Emily and I were born that morning and you became a mother. Holy crap that is wild. At 35 years old, you and Dad welcomed us into the world and thank God for that.

I have to be honest, I don't remember much, but I love the stories you have of us. Only one of us crying at a time stands out to me, I'm sure that was a blessing. You took some years off of work to take care of us, Dad took one week, haha!
